## Project Instructions

1. Open the starter project from the github repo in Android Studio
2. Add the navigation libraries to the app build.gradle file
3. Add the safe-arg plugin to the main and app build.gradle file
4. Set DataBindingUtil in build.gradle
5. Use DataBindingUtil to inflate every layout
6. Create a new navigation xml file
6. Create a new Login destination.

- Include email and password labels
- Include email and password fields
- Create buttons for creating a new login and logging in with an existing account
- Clicking either button should navigate to the Welcome Screen.

8. Create a new Welcome screen destination that includes:

- A new layout
- At least 2 textviews and use any text you would like
- A navigation button with actions to navigate to the instructions screen

9. Create a new Instruction destination that includes:

- A new layout
- At least 2 textviews with appropriate information
- A navigation button with actions to navigate to the shoe list screen

10. Create a class that extends ViewModel

- Use a LiveData field that returns the list of shoes

11. Create a new Shoe List destination that includes:
- A new layout
- A ScrollView
- A LinearLayout inside the ScrollView for Shoe Items
- A FloatingActionButton with an action to navigate to the shoe detail screen
12. In MainActivity, setup the nav controller with the toolbar and an AppBarConfiguration
13. n MainActivity, add a Logout menu to return to the login screen

14. Create a new Shoe Detail destination that includes:

- A new layout
- A TextView label and EditView for the Shoe Name, Company, Shoe Size and Description
- A Cancel button with an action to navigate back to the shoe list screen
- A Save button with an action to navigate back to the shoe list screen and add a new Shoe to the Shoe View Model.
- Hint: In the Shoe List destination, to add a child view programmatically to a ViewGroup, such as LinearLayout, use the addView() method. Refer to a sample implementation in the StackOverflow discussion here.

15. Make sure you canâ€™t go back to onboarding screens In the Shoe List screen:
- use an Activity level ViewModel to hold a list of Shoes (use by activityViewModels)
- Observe the shoes variable from the ViewModel
- Add a new layout item into the scrollview for each shoe.
